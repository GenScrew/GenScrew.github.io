## Geometric Algebra Primer
> Jaap Suter — March 12, 2003

Adopted with great enthusiasm in physics, geometric algebra slowly emerges in computational science. Its elegance and ease of use is unparalleled. By introducing two simple concepts, the multivector and its geometric product,
we obtain an algebra that allows subspace arithmetic. It turns out that being able to ‘calculate’ with subspaces is extremely powerful, and solves many of the hacks required by traditional methods. This paper provides an introduction to geometric algebra. The intention is to give the reader an understanding of the basic concepts, so advanced material becomes more accessible.


## The Inner Products of Geometric Algebra
> Leo Dorst

Making derived products out of the geometric product requires care in consistency. We show how a split based on outer product and scalar product necessitates a slightly different inner product than usual. We demonstrate the use and geometric significance of this contraction, and show how it simplifies treatment of meet and join. We also derive the sufficient condition for covariance of expressions involving outer and inner products.
