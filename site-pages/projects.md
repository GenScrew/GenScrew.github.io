# Projects

You will find here the various projects we are carrying out to automate calculations on generalized screws and coscrews.

## GScrew
[GScrew](https://github.com/GenScrew/GScrew) is A Python module to manipulate generalized Screws and Coscrews with geometric algebras (Clifford algebras). To provide a complete and independant framework, GScrew also implements n-dimensionnal geometric algebra and multivectors.
