## GScrew
[GScrew](https://github.com/GenScrew/GScrew) is A Python module to manipulate generalized Screws and Coscrews with geometric algebras (Clifford algebras). To provide a complete and independant framework, GScrew also implements n-dimensionnal geometric algebra and multivectors.

## GSL
Generalized Screw Library is a future library written in C++ that will implement n-dimensional geometric algebras and generalized screws to perform fast calculations on these objects.
