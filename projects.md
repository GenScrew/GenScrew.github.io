## GScrew
[GScrew](https://github.com/GenScrew/GScrew) is a Python module to manipulate generalized Screws and Coscrews with geometric algebras (Clifford algebras). To provide a complete and independant framework, GScrew also implements n-dimensional geometric algebras and multivectors.

## GSCL
[Generalized Screw Calculus Library](https://github.com/GenScrew/GSCL) (a.k.a. GSCL) is a future library written in C++ that will implement n-dimensional geometric algebras and generalized screws to perform fast calculations on these objects.
