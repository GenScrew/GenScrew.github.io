# Geometry for Quantum Science

Welcome on the GeQS website!

The Geometry for Quantum Science (GeQS) research group is a group of students mainly based at the University of Strasbourg, and organized around the [Faculty of Physics and Engineering](https://physique-ingenierie.unistra.fr/) and the [Quantum Science and Nanomaterials](https://qmat.unistra.fr/) Interdisciplinary Thematic Institute (QMat). It aims at developping new theoretical and computational tools for fundamental physics, namely through Geometric Algebra (real Clifford algebras) and generalized screw theory.

## Who are we?

### Romain Beauclaire
> *Student in mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Strasbourg.*

Highly interested in applied mathematics, Romain helps us tackle mathematical issues within the framework we are elaborating. He's currently working on screw differential calculus.

### Simon Beaudoin
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Mainly interested in subatomic and high energy physics, Simon shares with us his helpful experience in quantum field theory. (He also has Feynman's head on his sockets.)

### Loris Delafosse
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Seeking to obtain new geometrical insight into known physical phenomena, Loris is responsible for the early developments of the generalized screw formalism.

### Amr Hussein
> *Student in fundamental physics, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Always eager to find geometrical meaning in physical theories, Amr raises useful new questions and interpretations.

### Maxence Pandini
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Namely interested in statiscal and quantum mechanics, Maxence helps us carrying out lengthy calculations that arise in Geometric Algebra. (Also, don't mention polymers when you're talking to him.)

### Antoine Royer
> *Student in oceanography, atmospheric physics and climatology and TESS member, Faculty of Sciences and Engineering, University of Toulouse III (Paul Sabatier).*

As the group's computer technician, Antoine develops new computational tools supporting our theoretical research.
