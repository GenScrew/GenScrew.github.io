# Geometry for Quantum Science

Welcome on the GeQS website!

The Geometry for Quantum Science (GeQS) research group is a group of students mainly based at the University of Strasbourg, and organized around the Faculty of Physics and Engineering and the Quantum Science and Nanomaterials Interdisciplinary Thematic Insitute (QMat). It aims at developping new theoretical and computational tools for fundamental physics, namely through Geometric Algebra (real Clifford algebras) and generalized screw theory.
