# Geometry for Quantum Science (GeQS)

Welcome on the GeQS website!

We are a group of physics students aiming to develop new geometrical tools for fundamental physics, notably through geometric algebras (real Clifford algebras) and generalized screw theory.

## Who are we?

### Loris Delafosse
> *Student in physics, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Perhaps, if you're patient enough, some content will be added here!

### Antoine Royer
> *Student in oceanography, atmospheric physics and climatology, Faculty of Sciences and Engineering, University of Toulouse III (Paul Sabatier).*

I Manage the IT part of the project, providing and maintaining a fully documented Python package.
