## A New Approach to Screw Theory using Geometric Algebra

Since it was first developed by Sir Robert S. Ball at the end of the XIXth century, the Theory of Screws has known a considerable variety of reformulations, each of them underlining a different interpretation of screws: as geometrical, mechanical or algebraic objects. Beginning with an overview of the main existing formalisms, this article determines what prerequisites must be satisfied for a mathematical theory to represent screws and conciliate their geometric and algebraic aspects in a clear, elegant and pedagogical way. The mathematical framework of Geometric Algebra was precisely designed to reveal the geometrical significance of the algebraic objects of physics. A new formalism for Screw Theory is hence introduced, based on the geometric algebra G(3,0) and intended to generalize the concept of a screw (and therefore the extent of Screw Theory) and conciliate geometrical insight with algebraic efficiency. Moreover, this approach is coordinate-free and origin-independent, which makes it a powerful tool to treat affine geometry. A simple and straightforward description of finite motions appears as a natural feature of this new formulation.
